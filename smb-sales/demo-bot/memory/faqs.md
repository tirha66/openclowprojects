*20 realistic questions a salon client would ask, answered as Luna.*

**1. What are your opening hours?**

We're open Monday 10am–6pm, Tuesday to Friday 9am–7pm, and Saturday 9am–5pm. We're closed on Sundays. Last appointments are booked 45 minutes before we close, so if you're hoping for a late slot, it's worth booking a little ahead. ✨

---

**2. Where are you located?**

You'll find us at 14 Marlborough Place, Marylebone, London W1G 8DT — just a short walk from Baker Street and Regent's Park tube stations. There's also paid parking nearby if you're driving.

---

**3. How do I book an appointment?**

You can book online at [www.glowstudio.co.uk/book](http://www.glowstudio.co.uk/book) — it's quick and shows real-time availability. You can also message me here and I can take your details to pass to the team, or give us a ring on 020 7946 0832.

**4. How much is a haircut?**

A women's cut and blow-dry starts from £65, and men's cuts start from £35. Prices can vary slightly based on hair length and the stylist you book with. If you let me know a bit more about what you're after, I can give you a more accurate estimate.

**5. How long does a balayage take?**

Balayage typically takes between 2.5 and 3.5 hours, depending on your hair length and the look you're going for. It starts from £150 and includes a blow-dry. If you haven't been to us before, our stylist will chat through the look with you at the start of your appointment.

---

**6. Do I need a patch test before a colour appointment?**

Yes — if you're a new client booking any colour service of 90 minutes or more, we do require a patch test at least 48 hours beforehand. It's a quick, simple process and it's there to keep you safe. Just pop in or let us know and we'll arrange it for you.

---

**7. Can I request a specific stylist?**

Absolutely — just let us know who you'd like when you book and we'll do our best to accommodate. Our Creative Director Isabelle Renard is especially popular for colour and balayage, so her diary does book up — worth planning ahead if you'd like her.

---

**8. What is your cancellation policy?**

We ask for 48 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling — no charge at all if you give us that. If it's between 24 and 48 hours, we charge 50% of the service. For cancellations under 24 hours or no-shows, the full amount is charged. We know life gets busy though, so please always reach out as early as you can and we'll do what we can to help.

---

**9. Do I need to leave a card to book?**

Yes — we ask all clients to hold their booking with a card. You won't be charged anything upfront; it's just there in case of late cancellations. Your details are stored securely.

---

**10. How much is a gel manicure?**

A gel manicure is £45 and takes about an hour. If you'd like gel removal from a previous appointment added on, that's an extra £10. We also do a gel pedicure for £55 if you'd like to treat your feet at the same time 💅

---

**11. Do you do nail art?**

Yes — Chloe, our nail tech, does nail art from £3 per nail. If you have something specific in mind, it's worth letting us know when you book so she can set aside a bit of extra time.

---

**12. What facials do you offer?**

We have a range — from a 30-minute Express Facial (£55) if you're short on time, to our signature Deep-Cleanse (£80), Luxury Hydrating Facial (£100), and Anti-Ageing Facial (£110). Sofía, our skin therapist, can recommend the right one for your skin concerns if you're not sure where to start.

---

**13. Do you offer bridal packages?**

Yes, we love working with brides! We offer bridal hair trials from £85 and wedding day styling from £120. For larger bridal parties, it's best to get in touch directly at hello@glowstudio.co.uk so we can plan the day properly and make sure we have the right team in place.

---

**14. How much does highlights cost?**

Half head highlights start from £85 and a full head starts from £110 for shorter hair, up to £160 for longer hair. All colour services include a blow-dry. Prices are based on hair length and density, so there may be a small adjustment on the day — but your stylist will always chat through this with you first.

---

**15. Do you do children's haircuts?**

Yes — we offer children's cuts for under 12s from £30. We're a calm, welcoming space so little ones tend to feel at ease here.

---

**16. Can I walk in without a booking?**

We do occasionally have last-minute availability, but we'd always recommend booking in advance — especially for colour services and at weekends. You can check real-time availability at [www.glowstudio.co.uk/book](http://www.glowstudio.co.uk/book) or message me and I'll check for you.

---

**17. Do you have parking?**

We don't have our own car park, but there's paid street parking nearby and a few NCP car parks within a 5-minute walk. Most of our clients come by tube — Baker Street and Regent's Park are both close.

---

**18. What products do you use?**

We use a curated selection of professional brands including Wella Professionals for colour, Olaplex for treatments, and Dermalogica for our skin services. We also retail a range of products in the salon if you'd like to maintain your results at home.

---

**19. Can I get a quote for a colour correction?**

Colour correction is priced individually because every case is different — it really depends on your current colour, what you're aiming for, and the condition of your hair. The best first step is a consultation with Isabelle or one of our senior stylists. Would you like me to arrange that for you?

---

**20. What happens if I'm running late?**

Please let us know as soon as you can! If you're more than 15 minutes late, we may not be able to complete your full service, as it can affect appointments after yours. We'll always try to accommodate you, but we can't guarantee it if it's a significant delay. A quick message goes a long way — we really do understand that London traffic has a mind of its own.
