# Demo Script — Glow Studio AI Receptionist
## How to Run a Live Demo That Converts

---

## Before You Start: Setting the Scene

**What to say to the prospect:**

> "I'm going to show you exactly what your clients would experience from day one. This is a live AI receptionist — trained on a fictional salon called Glow Studio, but it works exactly the same way we'd set it up for your business.
>
> You can ask it anything a real customer would ask: prices, bookings, complaints, after-hours questions. It's not a demo environment with fake pre-loaded answers — it's actually thinking and responding in real time.
>
> I want you to try to catch it out. Ask the awkward stuff. That's how you'll really see what it can do."

**Why this framing works:**
- It positions you as confident (you're inviting them to test it)
- It makes the demo interactive — they're invested, not just watching
- It sets the expectation that this is real, not smoke and mirrors

## The 5 Demo Conversations

Work through these in order. Each one is designed to showcase a different capability.

---

### 🗓️ Conversation 1: Simple Booking Enquiry

**You (playing the customer):**
> "Hi, I'd like to book in for a balayage. I've never been before. How does it work?"

**What Luna should do:**
- Explain what a balayage is / how it works at Glow Studio
- Mention the price (from £150) and duration (2.5–3.5 hrs)
- Flag the patch test requirement for new colour clients
- Offer to help them book or direct them to the booking link

**What to highlight after:**
> "Notice it didn't just answer the question — it proactively flagged the patch test. That's something a good receptionist would do, and most businesses lose clients over it when the AI forgets. It's trained to catch those details."

---

### 💰 Conversation 2: Pricing & Upsell

**You (playing the customer):**
> "How much is a gel manicure? And do you do pedicures too?"

**What Luna should do:**
- Give the gel manicure price (£45)
- Mention the gel pedicure (£55) — naturally, without being salesy
- Possibly mention the nail art option or a combo

**What to highlight after:**
> "It answered the question and then mentioned the pedicure — not in a pushy way, just a natural 'while you're asking.' That's an upsell. A human receptionist might do that when they're not distracted — the AI does it every single time."

---

### 😠 Conversation 3: Complaint Handling

**You (playing the customer):**
> "I came in last week and honestly my highlights didn't turn out the way I wanted. I'm really disappointed. I spent £135 and I'm not happy."

**What Luna should do:**
- Acknowledge and validate the complaint — no defensiveness
- Express genuine empathy
- Offer to connect them with the team to resolve it (escalation)
- Not make any promises (refunds, free redo) without team authorisation

**What to highlight after:**
> "This is where a lot of businesses panic — they either get defensive or make promises they can't keep. Luna did neither. It acknowledged the disappointment, showed empathy, and escalated to the team. That's exactly the right response. It protects the business while making the client feel heard."

### 🌙 Conversation 4: After-Hours Enquiry

**You (playing the customer — set the context verbally first):**

*Say to the prospect:* "Imagine it's Sunday evening — the salon is closed. A potential client is browsing Instagram and sends a message."

**You (playing the customer):**
> "Hey, do you have any availability this week for a haircut and blow-dry? I'm free Wednesday or Thursday afternoon."

**What Luna should do:**
- Acknowledge the message warmly
- Confirm the salon is closed right now but she's available to help
- Give opening hours for context
- Take their preferred days/times and either point to the booking link or offer to pass their details to the team to confirm

**What to highlight after:**
> "It's Sunday night. Your actual receptionist is at home. But this potential client just reached out, and instead of hitting voicemail or being ignored until Monday, they got an immediate, helpful response. That's a booking that would have been lost. How many of those happen to your business every week?"

*(Let that question sit for a second.)*

### ✨ Conversation 5: The Curveball

**Hand the device to the prospect:**
> "Now you try. Ask it something you'd expect a customer to ask — or something you think it won't be able to handle."

Let them interact freely for 2–3 minutes.

**What to highlight after:**

Whatever happens, frame it positively:
- If it handles it well: "That's exactly why clients come back to businesses that use this."
- If it hits a limit: "Notice what it did — it didn't make something up or give a wrong answer. It said it wasn't sure and offered to connect them with the team. That's the right move. A bad receptionist guesses. This one escalates."

## The Closing Pitch

After the demo, say something like this:

> "What you just saw is exactly what we'd build for [their business name]. The only difference is it would know *your* services, *your* prices, *your* policies, and it would sound like *your* brand.
>
> Every time a client messages at 11pm, every time your phone rings while you're with a customer, every time someone asks 'how much is X?' — this handles it. Your team stays focused on the work that actually needs them.
>
> Setup takes about a week. The investment is [tier price]. Most of our clients cover the monthly cost with one or two bookings they would have otherwise missed.
>
> What questions do you have?"

**Then: stop talking.** Let them respond. The demo has done the selling — your job now is to listen.

## Tips for a Great Demo

- **Use a real device they can see clearly** — phone screen share or a tablet works well
- **Slow down** — give them time to read each response before moving on
- **Don't over-explain** — let the AI speak for itself; your commentary should be brief
- **Be genuinely curious about their reaction** — "what do you notice there?" is more powerful than "isn't that great?"
- **Have your pricing page ready** for when they ask "how much does this cost?"
