## 1. Salon / Spa

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hey [Owner's Name]! Love what you've built at [Business Name] — your feed is 🔥. Quick question: how are you handling booking enquiries that come in when you're mid-appointment or after hours? I help salons set up an AI receptionist that captures those leads 24/7. Happy to show you how it works — no pressure at all. — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Missing bookings while your hands are full?

Hi [Owner's Name],

Running a salon means your hands are literally full most of the day. Every call you miss while you're with a client is a potential booking walking straight to a competitor.

I help salon owners in [City] set up an AI receptionist that answers calls, books appointments, and handles FAQs — around the clock, without adding to your payroll.

It takes about a week to set up and sounds like a real person (because it's trained on your actual services and tone).

Worth a 15-minute chat? I can show you a live demo.

Hey [Owner's Name], just wanted to bump this up in case it got buried! I know things get hectic in the salon. If the timing's off, totally fine — just let me know and I'll check back later. If you're curious, I can send over a quick demo video instead. Either way, no stress! — [Your Name]

## 2. Restaurant / Café

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hi [Owner's Name]! [Business Name] looks incredible — those [dish/coffee shots] on your feed have me wanting to visit. Quick thought: are you losing reservation requests because the phone goes unanswered during service? An AI receptionist can handle bookings and enquiries 24/7. Takes the pressure off your floor staff. Mind if I show you? — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Your team shouldn't have to answer the phone mid-service

Hi [Owner's Name],

During a busy lunch or dinner service, the last thing your staff should be doing is picking up the phone to answer "do you take reservations?" for the fifteenth time that day.

I set up AI receptionists for restaurants in [City] that handle reservation requests, opening hours questions, dietary queries, and more — day and night.

Your team stays focused. No booking gets dropped.

Can I send you a 2-minute demo? No call required.

Hi [Owner's Name] — I know service never really stops in the restaurant world, so I'll keep this quick. I sent a message a few days ago about an AI receptionist that handles reservations and enquiries. If it's not relevant right now, no worries at all. But if you'd like to see it in action, just reply and I'll fire over a demo. — [Your Name]

## 3. Contractor / Trades

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hey [Owner's Name]! Noticed [Business Name] has some great reviews — clearly doing solid work. Do you ever miss calls when you're on-site and lose the job to someone who picked up faster? I help tradespeople set up an AI that answers calls, qualifies leads, and books callbacks automatically. Worth a look? — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** On the tools, missing calls, losing jobs?

Hi [Owner's Name],

If you're on a job site and your phone rings, you've got two choices: ignore it and risk losing the lead, or stop what you're doing and take the call. Neither is great.

I help contractors and tradespeople in [City] set up an AI receptionist that picks up every call, asks the right questions, and books a callback — so you never lose a lead because you were elbow-deep in a job.

It's always on, never calls in sick, and costs a fraction of a part-time receptionist.

Want me to show you how it works?

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hi [Owner's Name], just a quick follow-up on my message from a few days back. I know you're probably flat out on jobs — that's kind of the whole point of what I do. If you get five minutes, I'd love to show you how other tradespeople are handling this. If the timing's off, just say so and I'll reach out another time. — [Your Name]

## 4. Real Estate Agent

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hi [Owner's Name]! Been following your listings at [Business Name] — great properties. Do you ever miss enquiry calls when you're in a viewing or out of hours? I help agents set up an AI that qualifies leads and captures contact details 24/7, even on a Sunday evening. Happy to show you how it works! — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Sunday night enquiries — are you capturing them?

Hi [Owner's Name],

Real estate leads don't follow business hours. A buyer sees a listing at 10pm on a Sunday, calls, gets voicemail — and contacts the next agent on the list by Monday morning.

I set up AI receptionists for agents in [City] that answer enquiries instantly, qualify the lead, and capture their details — any time of day.

You wake up to warm leads, not missed calls.

Could I show you a quick live demo? Takes about 10 minutes.

[Your Name]
[Your Contact / Link]

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hi [Owner's Name] — quick follow-up from a few days ago. I imagine your schedule is non-stop with viewings and listings. If you want, I can just send over a short video of how the AI handles a live call — no meeting needed. Or if now's not the right time, just let me know. — [Your Name]

## 5. Gym / Fitness Studio

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hey [Owner's Name]! [Business Name] looks like an amazing community — love what you're building. Do you ever get membership enquiries when you're coaching a class and can't pick up? I help fitness studios set up an AI receptionist that handles sign-up questions, class schedules, and bookings 24/7. Worth a chat? — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Membership enquiries going to voicemail while you coach?

Hi [Owner's Name],

When you're running a class, you can't be everywhere. But every unanswered membership enquiry is potential monthly revenue that just walked out the door.

I help gym and studio owners in [City] set up an AI receptionist that answers calls and messages around the clock — class schedules, membership questions, trial bookings — all handled automatically.

Your energy stays on your members. The AI handles the rest.

Can I show you a demo? It's live, so you'd actually see it answer questions in real time.

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hey [Owner's Name]! Just bumping this up in case it got lost in the chaos of running a studio 😄 I know it's non-stop. If you want I can just send you a short clip showing the AI in action — no call needed. Either way, hope the studio's going well! — [Your Name]

## 6. Retail / E-commerce

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hi [Owner's Name]! Love the [Business Name] brand — really clean aesthetic. Quick thought: how do you handle customer questions that come in after hours? Order status, returns, product questions? I help retail brands set up an AI that handles all of that automatically, so customers aren't waiting until Monday for an answer. Want to see it? — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Customers asking questions at midnight — are they getting answers?

Hi [Owner's Name],

Your online store doesn't close at 5pm — but your customer support does. Every unanswered "where's my order?" at 9pm is a frustrated customer who might not come back.

I help retail brands in [City] set up an AI that handles customer enquiries 24/7 — order tracking, returns, product questions, stock availability — without adding headcount.

Customers get instant answers. You get fewer support tickets to deal with in the morning.

Would a quick demo be useful?

[Your Name]

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hi [Owner's Name] — just following up on my message from a few days ago. I know running a retail business is relentless. If it's not the right moment, totally fine — just let me know when's better. If you're curious, I'm happy to send a short demo video you can watch at your own pace. — [Your Name]

## 7. Dental / Medical Clinic

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hi [Owner's Name]! I came across [Business Name] and noticed you have some wonderful patient reviews. Do you find your reception team is often tied up with routine appointment queries when they could be focused on patients in the practice? I help clinics set up an AI that handles appointment bookings and FAQs automatically. Happy to show you how. — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** Is your reception team spending too much time on hold?

Hi [Owner's Name],

Your reception staff are brilliant — but spending half their day answering "can I book a check-up?" and "what are your opening hours?" isn't the best use of their skills (or your budget).

I help dental and medical practices in [City] set up an AI receptionist that handles routine bookings, appointment reminders, and patient FAQs — freeing your team to focus on the patients in front of them.

Fully GDPR-aware and designed to hand off to a human instantly when needed.

Would a 15-minute demo be worthwhile?

[Your Name]
[Your Contact / Link]

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hi [Owner's Name], just a gentle follow-up on my earlier message about reducing the load on your reception team. I know practice management is never simple. If you'd like, I can put together a short summary of how other clinics in [City] are using this — no call needed. Just reply and I'll send it over. — [Your Name]

## 8. Logistics / Delivery

### 📱 Instagram / WhatsApp DM
Hey [Owner's Name]! Running logistics means your team is always on the move — hard to keep up with customer calls about delivery status and ETAs. I help logistics companies set up an AI that handles those calls and messages automatically, 24/7. Saves your team hours every week. Worth a quick look? — [Your Name]

### 📧 Email
**Subject:** How many "where's my delivery?" calls does your team take per day?

Hi [Owner's Name],

Every "where's my parcel?" call your team takes is time they're not spending on actual operations. Multiply that by 50 calls a day and you've got a serious drain on your resources.

I help logistics and delivery businesses in [City] set up an AI that handles status enquiries, delivery rescheduling requests, and customer FAQs automatically — without your team lifting a finger.

It works across phone, WhatsApp, and web chat. Always on.

Can I show you how it works in a quick demo?

[Your Name]
[Your Contact / Link]

### 🔁 Follow-up (3 days later)
Hi [Owner's Name] — quick follow-up from a few days ago. I know logistics never sleeps, so I'll keep this short. If you want to see a live demo of how the AI handles a "where's my delivery?" call, I can set that up in 10 minutes. Or I can send a video if a call doesn't work. Whatever's easier. — [Your Name]
