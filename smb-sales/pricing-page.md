## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Will it sound like a robot?**
No — and that's the whole point. Your AI receptionist is trained on your business, your tone, and the way you actually speak to customers. Most people can't tell the difference. If they ask directly, it will always be honest that it's an AI.

**2. What happens if the AI can't answer something?**
It knows its limits. When a question is too complex, emotionally sensitive, or outside its knowledge, it immediately escalates to a human — via call transfer, text notification, or a callback request. Nothing falls through the cracks.

**3. How long does setup take?**
Typically 5–10 days depending on your tier. We handle the entire setup: writing the knowledge base, training the AI on your services and FAQs, testing, and going live. You just need to give us about an hour of your time upfront.

**4. What if my business changes — new prices, new services?**
Just let us know and we'll update the AI within 24 hours. On Pro and Premium, you can request updates any time via your dashboard or support channel.

**5. Is my customer data safe?**
Yes. All conversations are encrypted, stored securely, and never sold or shared. We're fully GDPR-compliant and can provide a Data Processing Agreement on request.

**6. Can I cancel if it's not working for me?**
Absolutely. There's no minimum contract beyond the first month. If it's not the right fit, cancel anytime. We'd rather you be happy than locked in. (Though most clients stay — average retention is over 14 months.)

## What Our Clients Say

> *"I was sceptical at first — I didn't think an AI could represent my brand. Three months in, it's handling 80% of our inbound enquiries and my team actually has time to focus on clients."*
> **— [Placeholder Name], [Business Type], [City]**

> *"We were losing bookings every night when the office was closed. Since setting this up, we've seen a 30% increase in confirmed appointments. The ROI is obvious."*
> **— [Placeholder Name], [Business Type], [City]**

> *"Setup was painless. They trained the AI on our entire service menu and within a week it was answering questions better than some of our new staff."*
