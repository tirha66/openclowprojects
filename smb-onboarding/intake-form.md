# AI Employee Intake Form

Hey! Welcome aboard. 👋

Before we build your AI employee, we need to get to know your business. This form covers everything we need to set things up properly — the more detail you give us, the better your AI will perform from day one.

There are no wrong answers. Just be honest and specific. Think of this as us having a coffee and getting to know your business properly.

**Estimated time to complete:** 20–40 minutes

## Section 7: Escalation Rules

Not everything should be handled by the AI. Let's get clear on where the handoff happens.

**What should the AI always handle on its own?** *(e.g. answering FAQs, sharing prices, booking instructions)*
> 

**What should the AI ALWAYS escalate to a human?** *(e.g. complaints, large orders, anything over $X, legal questions)*
> 

**What's the expected response time when a human takes over?** *(e.g. within 2 hours during business hours)*
> 

**What happens outside business hours?** *(e.g. the AI should acknowledge the message and say someone will follow up in the morning)*
> 

**If a customer is clearly upset or frustrated, what should the AI do?**
> 

---

## Section 8: Competitors

This helps us make sure your AI positions you well — without saying anything dodgy.

**Who are your main competitors?** *(local businesses, national chains, online alternatives)*
> 

**What makes you different from them?** *(your honest answer — this becomes your AI's positioning)*
> 

**Is there anything you'd like the AI to say (or avoid saying) when customers compare you to a competitor?**
> 

---

## Section 9: Goals

Let's make sure we know what success looks like for you.

**What does success look like after 30 days?**
> 

**What does success look like after 60 days?**
> 

**What does success look like after 90 days?**
> 

**Is there a specific metric you care most about?** *(e.g. number of leads, time saved, customer satisfaction, response speed)*
> 

**Is there anything you're worried about with this setup?** *(totally fine to be honest — helps us address it upfront)*
> 

---

## Section 10: Hard Rules — What the AI Should NEVER Do

Every AI needs guardrails. Be as specific as you want here.

**Topics the AI should NEVER discuss:**
> 

**Things the AI should NEVER promise or commit to:**
> 

**Information the AI should NEVER share:** *(e.g. internal pricing, staff personal details, certain business info)*
