## Phase 3: Quality Checks 🔍

*Don't hand over to the client until all of these pass.*

### 3.1 Conversation Testing

Send at least 10 test messages covering the following scenarios. Mark each pass ✅ or fail ❌.

| # | Test Scenario | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic greeting / "What do you do?" | | |
| 2 | Asking about a specific service + price | | |
| 3 | Asking about business hours | | |
| 4 | Booking / how to get started | | |
| 5 | A question from the FAQ list | | |
| 6 | An unusual or off-topic question | | |
| 7 | A complaint or frustrated message | | |
| 8 | A question the AI should escalate | | |
| 9 | After-hours message (send outside business hours) | | |
| 10 | Competitor comparison question | | |

### 3.2 Escalation Test

- [ ] **Triggered an escalation** — did the right person get notified?
- [ ] **Escalation message was clear** — human received enough context to take over
- [ ] **Response time reasonable** — escalation path works end-to-end

### 3.3 After-Hours Test

- [ ] **After-hours message triggers correctly** outside business hours
- [ ] **Message is on-brand and helpful** — not robotic or confusing
- [ ] **Follow-up timing correct** — customer knows when to expect a reply

### 3.4 Cron Job Test

- [ ] **Scheduled jobs fire at the right time**
- [ ] **Output looks correct** — correct formatting, no errors
- [ ] **Cron jobs don't conflict** with each other or with business hours

### 3.5 Tone Review

- [ ] **Read through the test conversation transcripts** — does the AI sound like the client's brand?
- [ ] **Check against intake form tone preferences** — formal/casual, specific phrases, things to avoid
- [ ] **No robotic or overly corporate language** slipping through
- [ ] **Errors or awkward phrasing identified and corrected**

**Overall quality sign-off:**
