>
> Let me know if you want a walkthrough! — [Your Name]

>
> — [Your Name]

## 🔧 CONTRACTORS (Plumbers / Electricians)

### Instagram / WhatsApp DM

> Hey [Owner Name]! Saw [Business Name] online — looks like you're doing great work.
>
> Quick one — do you get a lot of missed calls or leads that go cold before you get a chance to follow up? It's one of the biggest pain points for tradespeople I talk to.
>
> There's an AI tool that follows up leads automatically so you never lose a job to slow response time: https://megaai-liard.vercel.app
>
> Worth a look! — [Your Name]

### Email

**Subject:** Stop losing jobs to slow follow-up — [Business Name]

> Hi [Owner Name],
>
> When someone needs a plumber or electrician, they usually call 3–4 people and go with whoever responds first. If you're on a job and miss that call, the lead is gone.
>
> We help tradespeople fix this with an AI assistant that responds to enquiries instantly, qualifies the job, and books it in — even when you're busy on site.
>
> Check it out: https://megaai-liard.vercel.app

>
> — [Your Name]

### Email

**Subject:** Qualify more leads without doing it yourself — [Business Name]

> Hi [Owner Name],
>
> Most agents spend hours each week responding to tyre-kickers and unqualified enquiries. It's part of the job — but it doesn't have to be done manually.
>
> We help estate agents use AI to handle the first-touch response, qualify prospects, and only surface the hot leads to you. You focus on closing; the AI does the sifting.
>
> See how it works: https://megaai-liard.vercel.app
